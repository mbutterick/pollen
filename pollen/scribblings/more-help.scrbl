@section{Can I see the source for Practical Typography or Typography for Lawyers?}

Yes, the source for @link["http://typographyforlawyers.com/"]{Typography for Lawyers} is available. In terms of content, TFL was originally the basis of Practical Typography. But in terms of code, this new TFL website is essentially a clone of Practical Typography, but rewritten to be clearer and more instructive, with extensive source comments.
