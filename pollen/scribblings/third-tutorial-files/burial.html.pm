◊h1{I. The Burial of the Dead}

"You gave me hyacinths first a year ago;
They called me the hyacinth girl."
--- Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden,
Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not
Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither
Living nor dead, and I knew nothing,
Looking into the heart of light, the silence.
◊em{Od' und leer das Meer.}

Madame Sosostris, famous clairvoyante,
Had a bad cold, nevertheless
Is known to be the wisest woman in Europe,
With a wicked pack of cards.
