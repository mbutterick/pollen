◊h1{III. The Fire Sermon}

"Trams and dusty trees.	 
Highbury bore me. Richmond and Kew	 
Undid me. By Richmond I raised my knees	 
Supine on the floor of a narrow canoe."	
 
"My feet are at Moorgate, and my heart	 
Under my feet. After the event	 
He wept. He promised 'a new start.'	 
I made no comment. What should I resent?"
