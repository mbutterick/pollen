#|
161017:
This is a slightly amended version of scribble/text/output
that cooperates with the project splicing character.
Ordinarily, when the output function comes across a list, it will splice it into the surrounding string.
This version will also splice lists that begin with the splicing char.

;; See also `provide-special` below

;; Outputs values for the `scribble/text' language:
;; - several atomic values are printed as in `display',
;; - promises, thunks, and boxes are indirections for the value they contain
;;   (useful in various cases),
;; - some "special" values are used for controlling output (eg, flushing,
;;   prefix changes, etc),
;; - specifically, `block's delimit indentation levels, `splice's do not,
;; - lists (more generally, pairs) are like either one depending on the context
;;   (same as blocks/splices when inside a `block'/`splice'), at the toplevel
;;   they default to blocks.
;;
;; Uses global state because `output' is wrapped around each expression in a
;; scribble/text file so this is much more convenient than wrapping the whole
;; module's body in a `list' (which will be difficult with definitions etc).
;; The state is a pair of prefixes -- one that is the prefix for the current
;; value (which gets extended with nested blocks), and the other is the prefix
;; for the current "line" (which is reset after a newline).  The line-prefix is
;; needed because a line can hold a block, which means that the line-prefix
;; will apply for the contents of the block including newlines in it.  This
;; state is associated with a port via a hash table.  Another state that is
;; used is the port's column position, which is maintained by the system (when
;; line counts are enabled) -- this is used to tell what part of a prefix is
;; already displayed.
;;
;; Each prefix is either an integer (for a number of spaces) or a string.  The
;; prefix mechanism can be disabled by using #f for the global prefix, and in
;; this case the line prefix can have (cons pfx lpfx) so it can be restored --
;; used by `disable-prefix' and `restore-prefix' resp.  (This is different from
;; a 0 prefix -- #f means that no prefix will be accumulated).
