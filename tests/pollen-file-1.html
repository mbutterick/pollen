put-as-htmlroot-functionptopicclasssmallBibliographyplcThis is not, by any measure, a comprehensive bibliography. Rather, it’s a selection of favorites from my own bookshelf that I consult most frequently in my work as a writer and a typographer.psubheadwritingpBryan A.

(New York: Oxford University Press, 2009).pindentedstyleposition:relative;top:-0.4emLong before he agreed to write the foreword for my book bookTypography for Lawyers, Bryan Garner was a hero of mine. Garner thinks and writes about American English in a way that’s rigorous, convincing, and accessible. He is stern but not shrill; authoritative but not authoritarian. He is a vigorous advocate for clear, simple writing. His work should be mandatory reading for all writers.psubheadTypographypMatthew Butterick, bookTypography for Lawyers (Houston: Jones McClure Publishing, 2010).pindentedstyleposition:relative;top:-0.4emThe precursor to bookButterick’s Practical Typography.
