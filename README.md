Pollen: the book is a program
-----------------------------

A book-publishing system written in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org). Unstable. Incomplete. Et cetera. It’s becoming more civilized. But this is the actual software I use to publish & maintain my web-based book [Butterick's Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com).

Install from the command line like so:

    raco pkg install pollen
    
And update like so:

    raco pkg update pollen

Scribble docs are installed with the package. Or you can [read the docs here](http://mbutterick.github.io/pollen/doc/).
