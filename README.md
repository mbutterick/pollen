## Pollen: the book is a program [![Build Status](https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen/actions) [![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) 

A book-publishing system written in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org). This is the software I use to publish & maintain my web-based books [Beautiful Racket](http://beautifulracket.com), [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com), and [Typography for Lawyers](http://typographyforlawyers.com).

If you think documents should be programmable, youâ€™ll love it.  
If not, you can move along.

Pollen gives you access to a full programming language (Racket) with a text-based syntax that makes it easy to embed code within your documents.

## Project status

Actively developed, though the pace has slowed now that Pollen is arguably feature complete and stable. I use it almost every day so it's not going anywhere. But I have no plans to substantially enlarge or extend it.
