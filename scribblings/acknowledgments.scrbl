@title{Acknowledgments}

One curious aspect of free software is that you can appropriate the benefits of other people's work while making it look like your own. No such legerdemain here. Whatever effort I've put into Pollen is dwarfed by the epic accomplishments of the Racket development team. I thank all of them — especially @link["https://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/"]{Matthew Flatt}, @link["http://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~jay/home/"]{Jay McCarthy}, and @link["http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/"]{Matthias Felleisen} — for making this tremendous tool available, for adding several features I suggested, and for patiently answering my dumb questions over the months. 

Thank you to Greg Hendershott for his Markdown parser.

The best software tools do more than get the job done. They create an incentive to undertake jobs you wouldn't have attempted before. Racket encouraged me to become a better programmer so I could create Pollen. Likewise, I hope that Pollen encourages you to make things you couldn't before.
